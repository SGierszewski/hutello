# Hutello

> Find all dog daycare places in town

Hutello helps the user find all dog daycare places in town. The user can create a detailed profile for them and their dog(s) and search for "HuTas" ("Hundetagesst√§tten" in German) by city name. Detailed info for each HuTa can be viewed and it is planned to send a direct request for a free place.
