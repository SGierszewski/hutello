> Find all dog daycare places in town

My Hutello App is a work still in progress. It helps the user find all dog daycare places in town. The user can create a detailed profile for him/her and one or more dogs. A search function lets the user search all places in a given city, provides detailed info for a single "HuTa" ("Hundetagesst√§tte" in German) and offers the possibility to send a request to a chosen HuTa.
